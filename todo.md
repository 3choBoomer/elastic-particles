#H6 Tech debt coming from part of a larger solution
- more general injectable logging solution than winston
- clean up the client to do everything in raw or parsed mode
  - move away from using closure
- clean up filters and add unit tests

- rebuild client with parsed/raw modes, takes objects instead of string

#H6 Move to TypeScript
